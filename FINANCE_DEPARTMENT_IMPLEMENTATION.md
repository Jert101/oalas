# Finance Department Implementation - Complete

## üéØ **Overview**

The Finance Department has been successfully implemented with a complete role-based system that follows the same patterns as existing roles (Admin, Dean, Teacher) but with finance-specific functionality.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Approval Workflow**
```
PENDING ‚Üí DEAN_APPROVED ‚Üí APPROVED (by Finance)
PENDING ‚Üí DEAN_REJECTED ‚Üí DENIED (by Dean)
```

**Key Feature**: Finance can see ALL applications but can only approve after dean approval.

2. **DEAN_APPROVED** - Dean approved, ready for finance approval
3. **DEAN_REJECTED** - Dean rejected, no further action needed
4. **APPROVED** - Finance approved, final state
5. **DENIED** - Finance rejected, final state

### **Finance Actions**
- **View**: Can see all applications regardless of status
- **Approve**: Only for `DEAN_APPROVED` applications
- **Reject**: Only for `DEAN_APPROVED` applications with reason
- **No Action**: For `PENDING`, `DEAN_REJECTED`, `APPROVED`, `DENIED`
