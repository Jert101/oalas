## 🎉 Redirect Loop Issue - RESOLVED!

### 🔍 **Root Cause Identified:**
- **User Role**: "Non Teaching Personnel" (role_id: 2)
- **System Logic**: Only recognized "Teacher/Instructor" and "Dean/Program Head"
- **Result**: Redirect loop between `/admin/console` and `/dashboard`

### ✅ **Solution Applied:**

#### 1. **Added "Non Teaching Personnel" Role Support:**
- Updated dashboard routing logic
- Modified teacher dashboard access control
- Enhanced sidebar navigation logic
- Fixed fallback routing to prevent loops

#### 2. **Files Updated:**
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added Non Teaching Personnel to teacher routing
- `src/app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx` - Allowed Non Teaching Personnel access
- `src/app/admin/console/page.tsx` - Direct redirect to teacher dashboard
- `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Updated navigation and fallback logic

#### 3. **Role-Based Routing Now Supports:**
```typescript
// Admin Users
"Admin" → /admin/console

// Staff Users (all use teacher dashboard interface)
"Teacher/Instructor" → /teacher/dashboard
"Dean/Program Head" → /teacher/dashboard  
"Non Teaching Personnel" → /teacher/dashboard

// Unknown roles → /teacher/dashboard (safe fallback)
```

### 🛡️ **Redirect Loop Prevention:**
- **Changed all fallbacks** from `/admin/console` to `/teacher/dashboard`
- **Direct routing** instead of multiple hops
- **Inclusive role checking** for all staff types

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now:**
1. **Non Teaching Personnel users** can successfully access the teacher dashboard
2. **No more redirect loops** between admin and dashboard pages
3. **Clean navigation** with appropriate role-based access
4. **Consistent user experience** across all staff roles

### 📝 **Key Insight:**
The system was designed primarily for Teachers and Admins, but didn't account for "Non Teaching Personnel" users. This caused them to fall into fallback logic that created infinite redirects. Now all staff roles are properly handled with access to the appropriate dashboard interface.

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED - All user roles now have proper routing without loops!**
