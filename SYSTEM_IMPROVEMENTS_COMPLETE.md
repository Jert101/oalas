# OALASS System Improvements - Complete

## ✅ **Issues Fixed & Features Added**

### 1. **Dashboard Apply Button Validation** 
- **Problem**: Dashboard "Apply for Leave" button was enabled even when user had pending applications
- **Solution**: Added validation check to dashboard page that respects the same validation rules as the main leave page
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `canApply` state to track validation status
  - Added validation API call in `fetchDashboardData()`
  - Disabled "Apply for Leave" button when `!canApply`

### 2. **Edit/Delete Functionality for Pending Applications**
- **Problem**: Users couldn't edit or delete their pending applications
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive edit/delete system with proper validation
- **New Files Created**:
  - `src/app/api/teacher/leave-applications/[id]/route.ts` - API for leave application CRUD
  - `src/app/api/teacher/travel-order/[id]/route.ts` - API for travel order CRUD  
  - `src/components/edit-application-modal.tsx` - Modal component for editing
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/teacher/leave/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Edit pending applications (both leave and travel orders)
  - ✅ Delete pending applications
  - ✅ Disabled edit/delete for non-pending applications
  - ✅ Real-time form validation
  - ✅ Success/error notifications
  - ✅ Confirmation dialogs for deletion

### 3. **Removed Test Button from Notifications**
- **Problem**: Test button was cluttering the notification interface
- **Solution**: Removed test button and its associated function
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/notification-bell.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed "🧪 Test" button from notification header
  - Removed `testRealTimeNotification()` function
  - Cleaned up notification interface

### 4. **Green Dot Explanation**
- **What it is**: The green dot in the notification bell indicates **WebSocket connection status**
- **Meaning**:
  - 🟢 **Green dot**: WebSocket server is connected and real-time notifications are working
  - ⚫ **Gray dot**: WebSocket server is disconnected, notifications will only appear on page refresh
- **Location**: Bottom-right corner of the notification bell icon
- **Purpose**: Provides visual feedback about real-time notification system status
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses `wsConnected` state from WebSocket connection
  - Updates automatically when connection status changes
  - Helps users understand if real-time features are working

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **API Endpoints Created**

```

#### Travel Orders CRUD
```typescript
GET    /api/teacher/travel-order/[id]          // Get specific travel order
